## Inside this profile you'll find all the projects I've worked.

There are projects when I didn't have any experience with code, my firsts tries but with a lot of training hours.

Similarly there are projects when I was studying at **Ironhack** (Highly recommended). In fact, those 6 months were very important for me and my career.
